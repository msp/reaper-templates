The mono/stereo panner tracks are routed to the ambisonic decoder which can be automated on azimuth and elevation planes to place and move audio within a 3D space.

The free VSTs only provide mono, stereo and up to 5.1 surround but full 16 channel version is available to purchase.

The remaining, ungrouped channels are designed to be routed to individual audio interface outputs directly, bypassing the ambisonic system.

This template is good enough to get started working with 3D audio to create an ambisonic, multichannel
render which can be played back on tools like the "Harpex player":http://harpex.net/download.html.

The ideal scenario is to swap out the referenced decoder for the full 16 channel version and work
on an array of speakers but this will give you a reasonable reference on a stereo monitoring system.
